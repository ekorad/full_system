//
// Associating rt_OneStep with a real-time clock or interrupt service routine
// is what makes the generated code "real-time".  The function rt_OneStep is
// always associated with the base rate of the model.  Subrates are managed
// by the base rate from inside the generated code.  Enabling/disabling
// interrupts and floating point context switches are target specific.  This
// example code indicates where these should take place relative to executing
// the generated code step function.  Overrun behavior should be tailored to
// your application needs.  This example simply sets an error status in the
// real-time model and returns from rt_OneStep.
